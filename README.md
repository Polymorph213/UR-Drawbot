# UR-Drawbot
Allows you to draw vectorised images with a UR robot parametricly through the RobotExMachina Grasshopper plugin.

UR Drawbot is a Grasshopper script that allows you to draw with any UR robot via the Machina GH plugin and Machina Bridge.

In this script you are able to work with any vectorised image, and you can choose the color of each curve.

Currently, it is possible to draw with 4 colours, and the robot is also capable of changing the marker automaticly.

Big thank's to Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo from Parametric Camp for the awesome Machina Software and his contributions to the Grasshopper community.
